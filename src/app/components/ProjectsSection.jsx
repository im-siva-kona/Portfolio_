The project enhances human-computer interaction by identifying gestures in real-time and translating them into cursor movements. It uses finger tracking to detect which fingers are raised, managing the userâ€™s intent, and it visualizes hand movements and gesture recognition over time, providing smooth and responsive control. This project demonstrates expertise in AI, computer vision, and gesture-based control systems.",
